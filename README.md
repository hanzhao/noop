Noop.js
===

Maybe it wants to be a Node.js, but nothing it can do.

It's a simplified JavaScript interpreter, as our **Principles of Programming Languages** final project.

## Dependencies

Ubuntu
```sh
apt-get install libreadline-dev
```

Fedora
```sh
yum install readline-devel
```

ArchLinux
```sh
pacman -S readline
```

## Build

```sh
make
```

## Run

```sh
./noop --help
```

## Samples

Mostly, a simple JavaScript source code is acceptable. You can find some samples [here](https://github.com/magicae/noop/tree/master/test/samples).
