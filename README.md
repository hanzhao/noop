Maybe it wants to be a Node.js, but nothing it can do.

It's a simplified JavaScript interpreter, as our **Principles of Programming Languages** final project.

## Goals

+ Variable definition and assignment
  - var
+ Expression and Statement
  - =
  - \+ - \* / %
  - ()
  - \> \>= < <= == != ===
  - && || !
+ I/O
  - print (It's not a part of JavaScript, but we need it for debugging)
+ Conditional statement
  - if ... else ...
  - while ...
+ Function definition and evaluation
  - function func(...arguments) { /\*function body\*/ }
+ Object
